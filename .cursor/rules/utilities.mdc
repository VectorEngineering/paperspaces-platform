# Utility Functions in Documenso

## Core Utilities
- Utilities are organized in packages/lib or within each app's lib directory
- Server-only utilities should be placed in the `lib/server` directory
- Client utilities should be placed in the `lib/client` directory

## Common Utilities
- Use date-fns for date manipulation
- Use nanoid for generating unique IDs
- Use zod for data validation and parsing

## Document Utilities
- Use PDF manipulation utilities from `@documenso/pdf-sign` package
- Use shared document processing utilities from `@documenso/lib` package

# Utility Functions

- Use lodash utilities for common operations (arrays, objects, strings)
- Import specific lodash functions to minimize bundle size:
  ```typescript
  import groupBy from "lodash/groupBy";
  ```
- Create utility functions in `utils/` folder for reusable logic
- The `utils` folder also contains core app logic such as Next.js Server Actions and Gmail API requests.
